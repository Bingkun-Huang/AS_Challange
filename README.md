## Project description
This project is part of the Sub-Terrain Challenge in the Autonomous Systems course at TUM.
The objective is to develop a system that can autonomously explore a cave environment, detect and locate four objects of interest (lights), and generate a 3D voxel-grid or mesh representation of the environment.
The implementation involves a ROS-based framework, integrating perception, path planning, and control using a quadrotor and a Unity-based simulation.
